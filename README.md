# law-consultation-platform-java-spring
A full-stack group project developed during a university course.   The platform allows users to ask legal questions, and lawyers/startups can interact with them through a categorized system.

Features include:
- User registration & login
- Posting and viewing questions
- Lawyer profiles and startup listings
- Admin features (moderation and categorization)

Backend:
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- RESTful API
- MariaDB (tested DB)

Frontend
- React (developed by other teammates)
- Fetch API for communication with backend

Group Project â€” My Role

While most of the backend and frontend work was handled by teammates, I contributed to:
- Backend logic and testing (Java Spring Boot)
- Reviewing models and controllers
- Team documentation (slides, reports)

This project taught me how a full-stack application is structured and deployed in a collaborative setting.

**Note**

I was not responsible for the majority of code, but this project reflects my exposure to Spring Boot structure and my initial backend contributions in a group setting.
